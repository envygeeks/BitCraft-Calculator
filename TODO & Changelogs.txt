TODO:
    **Effort â†’ Time**
        add XP per ticks and XP Caculations
        reorganize the result calculations and change the background color of the result to blend better with the theme


    **Rarity Calculator**
        uncommon rarity results in white mode is too light and isn't very visible 

    **Tools & Materials**
        Change raw material to show all crafted materials and add another for raw material that can only be enabled if the other toggle is down. Add the data for it

    **All**
        do a clean up on all code, move all the style to css files only, dont integrate them within the html files - use unified styling accross the board for all the pages, if anything needs to be different make sure to implenet properly within the css file
        ensure light/dark mode are working properly, there are some inconsistencies now after going back some versions ago
        integrate all the proper changes needed in the partials files for header/fooder to have everything consistent accross the board for all the pages

    header
        add discord button with the link to my discord - with icon of discord and the purple colors of discord branding - https://discord.gg/xEHrnQqr
        remove bitcraftools and the animated icons - instead use the name of the tool title from the readme file along side with the website icon for the header
        make sure the name and logo are all the way on the right side of the page without much padding/margin
        the same goes for the discord buttong and the light/dark mode toggles to be all the way on the left
